# 🎆 Rolling Display on 8x8 LED Matrix 🎉  

## 🚀 Overview  
This project implements a **rolling visual display** on an **8x8 LED matrix**, showcasing dynamic scrolling of digits, letters, or any custom pattern. For demonstration, the project uses my **birthday date (e.g., 020821)** that scrolls like a ticker on the LED matrix. This project demonstrates the exciting possibilities of embedded systems and LED matrix control! 💡✨
